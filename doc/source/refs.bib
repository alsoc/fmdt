  abstract  = {Cet article pr{\'e}sente les techniques mises en œuvre pour parall{\'e}liser une nouvelle cha{\^i}ne de traitement de l'image. L’application permet de d{\'e}tecter automatiquement les m{\'e}t{\'e}ores depuis un flux vid{\'e}o non stabilis{\'e}. La cible finale de cette cha{\^i}ne de traitement est un syst{\`e}me sur puce {\`a} faible consommation {\'e}nerg{\'e}tique pouvant {\^e}tre embarqu{\'e} sur un ballon-sonde, ou bien dans un avion. Les m{\'e}thodes mises en place pour r{\'e}pondre aux contraintes de traitement temps r{\'e}el (> 25 images par seconde) tout en restant sur des niveaux de consommation {\'e}nerg{\'e}tique faible (< 10 Watts) sont pr{\'e}sent{\'e}es. En outre, la cha{\^i}ne de traitement est d{\'e}coup{\'e}e en graphe de t{\^a}ches puis elle est parall{\'e}lis{\'e}e. Les r{\'e}sultats obtenus d{\'e}montrent l’efficacit{\'e} de la parall{\'e}lisation. Par exemple, sur la Raspberry Pi 4, la cha{\^i}ne de traitement atteint 42 images par seconde et consomme moins de 6 Watts pour des s{\'e}quences vid{\'e}os Full HD.},

Fast Meteor Detection Toolbox (FMDT) is able to detect meteor sightings by analyzing videos acquired by cameras onboard weather balloons or within airplane with stabilization. The challenge consists in designing a processing chain composed of simple algorithms, that are robust to the high fluctuation of the videos and that satisfy the constraints on power consumption (10 W) and real-time processing (25 frames per second).},

From a set of carefully designed components, it enables to build efficient software digital communication systems, able to take advan- tage of the parallelism of modern processor architectures, in a straightforward and safe manner for the programmer. In particular, proposed DSEL enables the combination of pipelining and sequence duplication techniques to extract both temporal and spatial parallelism from digital communication systems. We leverage the DSEL capabilities on a real use case: a fully digital transceiver for the widely used DVB-S2 standard designed entirely in software. Through evaluation, we show how proposed software DVB-S2 transceiver is able to get the most from modern, high-end multi- core CPU targets.},

  abstract    = {Context. The existence of meteor clusters has long since been a subject of speculation and so far only seven events have been reported, among which two involve less than five meteors, and three were seen during the Leonid storms.
Aims. The 1995 outburst of Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann was predicted to result in a meteor shower in May 2022. We detected the shower, proved this to be the result of this outburst, and detected another meteor cluster during the same observation mission.
Methods. The tau-Herculids meteor shower outburst on 31 May 2022 was continuously monitored for 4 hours during an airborne campaign. The video data were analyzed using a recently developed computer-vision processing chain for meteor real-time detection. Results. We report and characterize the detection of a meteor cluster involving 38 fragments, detected at 06:48 UT for a total duration of 11.3 s. The derived cumulative size frequency distribution index is relatively shallow: s = 3.1. Our open-source computer-vision processing chain (named FMDT) detects 100\% of the meteors that a human eye is able to detect in the video. Classical automated motion detection assuming a static camera was not suitable for the stabilized camera setup because of residual motion.
Conclusions. From all reported meteor clusters, we crudely estimate their occurrence to be less than one per million observed meteors. Low heliocentric distance enhances the probability of such meteoroid self-disruption in the interplanetary space.},

  abstract     = {Detection and characterization of meteoroids and space debris that enter into our atmosphere is one of the main concerns of astronomers. This work presents a computer vision application to detect meteors from video sequences. This application is designed to be embedded in satellites, in weather balloons or for airborne observation campaigns. The system runs on CPUs and is robust to non-stabilized cameras and noisy video sequences. It is evaluated on the 2022 Tau-Herculids video sequence where an overall tracking rate of 80.4\% is obtained. All the visible meteors are detected. Experiment results demonstrate that the system runs efficiently with limited power thanks to the use of multithreading techniques (pipeline and fork-join parallelism). For example, on the 2022 Tau-Herculids HD video sequence, the system reaches 30 FPS on the Raspberry Pi 4 while the instant power is only 3.8 Watts.},
