  abstract    = {Context. The existence of meteor clusters has long since been a subject of speculation and so far only seven events have been reported, among which two involve less than five meteors, and three were seen during the Leonid storms.
Aims. The 1995 outburst of Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann was predicted to result in a meteor shower in May 2022. We detected the shower, proved this to be the result of this outburst, and detected another meteor cluster during the same observation mission.
Methods. The tau-Herculids meteor shower outburst on 31 May 2022 was continuously monitored for 4 hours during an airborne campaign. The video data were analyzed using a recently developed computer-vision processing chain for meteor real-time detection. Results. We report and characterize the detection of a meteor cluster involving 38 fragments, detected at 06:48 UT for a total duration of 11.3 s. The derived cumulative size frequency distribution index is relatively shallow: s = 3.1. Our open-source computer-vision processing chain (named FMDT) detects 100\% of the meteors that a human eye is able to detect in the video. Classical automated motion detection assuming a static camera was not suitable for the stabilized camera setup because of residual motion.
Conclusions. From all reported meteor clusters, we crudely estimate their occurrence to be less than one per million observed meteors. Low heliocentric distance enhances the probability of such meteoroid self-disruption in the interplanetary space.},

  abstract     = {Detection and characterization of meteoroids and space debris that enter into our atmosphere is one of the main concerns of astronomers. This work presents a computer vision application to detect meteors from video sequences. This application is designed to be embedded in satellites, in weather balloons or for airborne observation campaigns. The system runs on CPUs and is robust to non-stabilized cameras and noisy video sequences. It is evaluated on the 2022 Tau-Herculids video sequence where an overall tracking rate of 80.4\% is obtained. All the visible meteors are detected. Experiment results demonstrate that the system runs efficiently with limited power thanks to the use of multithreading techniques (pipeline and fork-join parallelism). For example, on the 2022 Tau-Herculids HD video sequence, the system reaches 30 FPS on the Raspberry Pi 4 while the instant power is only 3.8 Watts.},
